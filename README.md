# Notes-for-fastai-part-1-course-version-3

**Welcome to my note pages. I have taken these notes from the beginning of my fast.ai journey. These follow the [Practical Deep Learning for Coders, v3](https://course.fast.ai/) lessons, and are raw and unfiltered. I felt it important to show the progression of both my general programming skill, and also my progression in learning the vast fast.ai frameworks. My personal notes will be bolded just like this cell.**

**It's important to note that you will see mistakes and my general mentionings of not knowing what's happening. I left this there. I want any users who venture on this quest to understand that it's difficult for anyone approaching these topics, let alone a novice such as myself. Hopefully you will find some comfort in knowing you're not alone. Also, I want to point out that this type of note taking is a fantastic way to enhance your learning during the lessons provided by this course. I encourage you to do the same, even when you're in the weeds and not knowing what's happening. You will get out of them eventually.**
